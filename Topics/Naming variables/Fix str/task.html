<h2>Fix str</h2>
<html><body><p>The previous developer accidentally named a variable <code class="java">str</code>. Since this name is reserved for a built-in type, the code below fails.</p>
<p>Fix the variable name by adding an underscore, as suggested in the topic. The value of the variable shouldn't change, i.e. in the first line it should be <code class="java">Hello</code> and in the second line it should be <code class="java">Hello10</code>. Mind that you should NOT create a new variable in the second line. Use the same variable as you used in the first line.</p>
<p>You don't have to print anything. Remember that the <code class="java">str()</code> function returns the string version of the given object.</p></body></html><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>

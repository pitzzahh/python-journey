<h2>Everest</h2>
<p>In your program, you need a variable to store the height of mount Everest (8, 848 m). There are other heights and other mountains in the program, so you cannot simply call it <code class="java">height</code> . The name of the variable should reflect the fact that the value is <strong>constant</strong> and refer to the <strong>measure</strong> and the<strong> object</strong>.</p>

<p>What would be an optimal name for that variable?</p>

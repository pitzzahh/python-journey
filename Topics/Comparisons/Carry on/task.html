<h2>Carry on!</h2>
<p>If you've ever traveled by plane, you know that there are strict rules when it comes to carry-on luggage. A handbag has three dimensions: <strong>width, length </strong>and <strong>height. </strong>Some company set the following rule for the carry-on:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">allowed = (height &lt;= 10 &lt; width &lt;= 35 &lt; length &lt;= 40) or (height + width + length &lt;= 80)</code></pre>

<p>Which carry-ons are going to be allowed on a plane?</p>
